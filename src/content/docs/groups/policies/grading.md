## Grading and Assessment

# Final Grade

- Class participation: 15%
- Assignments: 15%
- Paper 1: 30%
- Paper 2: 40%

# Class Participation

- Your class participation grade is based on how seriously I think you are engaged with the class.
- If you attend regularly, pay attention, ask questions, answer course emails promptly, bring your materials to class, and see me in office hours, your grade goes up.
- If you chat with other students during lecture/discussion, sleep, miss class without discussing it with me, frequently arrive late,  or don't ask or answer questions (in or out of class), your grade goes down.
- Most students meet the baseline expectation: they attend almost all classes, bring their readings to class, answer emails promptly, bring their materials to class, and pay attention. If you do this and also sometimes speak in class, you will get an average grade. If you exceed the baseline, you will get an above average grade. If you fail to meet the baseline (rarely speak, often tardy, miss classes and assignments), you will get a below average grade.
- I understand that some students are shy and have trouble speaking in class. Please note:
  - You can make up for not speaking in class by showing me your engagement in other ways, such as posting to the discussion boards, talking with me outside of class, completing all assignments on time, and emailing me interesting links relevant to the course.
  - I observe your contributions to small group discussions, not just whole-class discussions, and those count towards participation as well.
- I consider asking clarifying questions or suggesting answers that turn out to be wrong to be just as important as contributing new ideas and suggesting answers that turn out to be right. Your participation grade does not depend on saying only things that are correct.
- Actively listening to others is an important part of participating in discussion. Class discussions should not be competitive, with students striving to answer the most questions correctly. I am much more interested in whether the class as a whole develops a dialog that moves our understanding forward, and listening to others and asking clarifying questions is essential to that goal.
- One aspect of class participation is providing feedback to me about the course. At the end of every class, I will ask you to post questions or comments about anything we discussed in class that day. You can take this opportunity to provide me feedback about the course and my teaching to help me make continuous improvement.

# Assignments

- In this course, "assignments" refers not to everything assigned, but to shorter assignments that are not directly related to Paper 1 and Paper 2.
- The most effective way to improve writing is through frequent practice and feedback. Students will regularly be asked to submit short written assignments for class.
- Assignments are not given individual grades, but are assessed holistically as a group at the end of the semester. I consider improvement across the semester in determining your grade.
- Assignments may be of three types:
  - Discussion posts on the Canvas "Discussion" pages
  - Short assignments individually submitted on Canvas
  - Short assignments to be written and distributed in class meetings for discussion.
- I do not expect the assignments to provide brilliant insights. I expect them to show your thoughts about the readings based on the prompt, even if your thoughts are confused or you have many questions.
- The assignments (and the papers!) should be written grammatically with a focus on simple language and clear communication.
  - Write grammatically so I know that any writing errors are not due to carelessness, but are things that I need to teach you.
  - Write with a focus on simple language and do NOT try to impress me or your classmates with your big vocabulary. It often backfires and goes against the main purpose of academic writing, which is communicating your ideas effectively.
- Formal citation and quotation is not necessary in short assignments (unless otherwise indicated)
- Do not do any outside research for the assignments. The assignments are ways to encourage your thinking, they are not research assignments where you are supposed to get ideas from other people or sources.
- Do not write introductions or conclusions for the assignments. Get right to the point.
- I may hand out copies of submitted assignments (with names removed) in class to aid discussion.
- Assignments (and papers) are always due at 11:59pm. Proper sleep is important for health (both physical and mental) and I do not want you staying up late to finish.
- You may resubmit assignments until the deadline if needed (for example, if you accidentally deleted part of the response before submitting).
- Don't skip assignments because you are worried that your response won't be good enough. That will kill your grade. Submit something and even if you don't get credit, at least I can give you feedback.
- Never skip an assignment without communicating with me. You must complete all assignments to pass the course, including short assignments and all parts of each paper assignment. If you miss an assignment, write me to explain the lack of on-time submission and suggest a way to move forward.
- Assignment Comments
	- I will not always make significant comments on your assignments, but I do read them all thoroughly.
	- I will write at least a word or two on your first assignment submitted through Canvas to make sure you can see future comments. Check to make sure.
	- I do not provide substantial written feedback on short assignments. Written feedback is extremely time-consuming to produce and it is simply impossible for me to provide it for every assignment. You will receive indirect feedback on your submission during class discussion, and you are _always_ welcome to ask for additional feedback by scheduling a meeting with me.

# Papers 1 and 2

Paper 1 asks students to respond to an argument from one of the assigned readings; Paper 2 asks students to contribute to an academic discussion about art and evolution using multiple sources.

Both papers will have students submit proposals, outlines, and/or drafts for instructor and peer feedback to make sure students have enough guidance to produce successful work. Explicit guidance and grading criteria will be provided in class and elsewhere on the course website.

# Paper Feedback

I will provide feedback on assignments leading up to the final draft of your two main papers. When grading the final, I often notice problems that I remember mentioning in conferences or as written feedback on previous assignments. Take great care to avoid ignoring issues that I explicitly mention. The failure to address mentioned issues probably comes from a multitude of factors, including the workload and time pressure put on NUSC students. However, from an instructor's perspective, it is easy to interpret these problems is as indicating that the student did not think the advice or the assignment was important enough to address.
