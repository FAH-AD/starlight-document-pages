title: Generative AI policy
---
Generative AI (hereafter GenAI) includes tools such as ChatGPT, Microsoft CoPilot, Gemini, and other software that generates text. It doesn't include basic computer-assisted editing such as Grammarly basic or the grammar check function in Word.

GenAI policy in this course should be understood in relation to the NUS Academic Honesty policy.

Please read NUS guidance on [use of AI tools generally](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-4), [using AI tools for assignments](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-5), and [plagarism](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/copyright_essentials_teaching_learning_research/plagiarism). Relevant sections of the NUS Code of Student Conduct are [here](https://www.nus.edu.sg/celc/statements-and-e-resources-on-plagiarism/)

This course is very permissive about use of GenAI tools for your papers and assignments. You may use GenAI for any element of the coursework with no penalty, but ONLY if the assignment includes a link to all chats relevant to the coursework (or a transcript of the chat). It is not enough to provide a general description of the way you used GenAI; I need to see the actual chat text itself. If you do not use GenAI for an assignment or paper, you must state this.

If you use GenAI and DO NOT include the actual chat text, the use will be considered a violation of academic honesty with consequent penalties. So for each coursework submission, your choices are either: 1) do not use GenAI at all and include a statement confirming this, or 2) use GenAI in any way, with no penalty, and send me a link to all chats you have with the AI.

I will check to see if you have included the transcripts, but I don't plan to actually analyze them until this summer. I won't consider the content of your chats when grading your assignments. Use of GenAI will not hurt your grade unless you use it without sharing the chats with me (in which case the consequences could be serious; please don't do this—I hate failing students).

This is not a trick, or an honesty test, or reverse psychology, or anything like that. I am not like other teachers. I am doing this because I want to gather honest data about how students use GenAI in writing as part of my teaching research. Do not edit the chats, or worry that you said something dumb in the chats, or try to trick the system. I don't care at all how you use GenAI for the coursework as long as you share the chat with me. I want you to use GenAI if you want to try it. If you can figure out how to write the entire paper using GenAI with minimal effort, good for you, as long as you show me your steps by giving me the chat. I'll give you an A if the final output is an A paper. But I MUST see how you use it because right now no one anywhere knows anything about how students actually use this technology and it's important that we learn more about it.

### Logistics

For each submitted assignment or paper:

- If you don't use GenAI, include a statement in your paper "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment."
- If you use GenAI, include either links to all of your chats or a transcript of all of your chats.
- ChatGPT provides an easy way to share chats with links—see [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/2bcd2432-3f9f-4596-a1e0-f383437c7ea5). If you use ChatGPT as your tool, it is easy to copy and paste the link.
- If you use other tools that let you copy transcripts with a link, that's fine as long as I can definitely access the chat without having to sign up for your tool. You must check this with a different computer that isn't logged into your GenAI account.
- If you use other tools that don't allow sharing chat links, you must download the entire chat—both prompts and outputs—into a file, and you must do this for every single chat you create. If there are tools that make this easier for you, please share them with me. But don't get lazy and just give up halfway through because that violates academic honesty policies for this course and could have serious consequences.
- I don't care you send me 50 links per paper or 100+ pages of chat transcripts. Send all of it.
- One useful tool if you don't have a paid ChatGPT account is [Long PROMPTs Splitter](https://chatgpt-prompt-splitter.jjdiaz.dev/).
