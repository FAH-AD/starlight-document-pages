# Assignment formatting

- Short assignments should be typed directly into the provided text box. Please do _not_ paste a link to a document into the text box for short assignments.
- If the assignment is in response to an assigned reading, put the title of the reading at the top of your assignment (and specific section or pages if needed to disambiguate).
- Include the following information on all assignments:
	- the name I call you in class, especially if it is not the name registered with NUS
	- your section (E1 or E2)
	- a word count at the bottom
	- a GenAI no-use statement or links to your chats

# Paper formatting

- The following guidelines refer to assignments related to major papers.
- Submit paper assignments as MS Word documents, _not_ a pdf or other file format.
- Find an example properly formatted paper [here](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/users/90279/files/3681962/download?verifier=zqjoVhp8AE0JuUtO6eFSQwnNykYu07cySVHXNzNQ&download_frd=1).
- The paper must be double-spaced, left-justified, with numbered pages and standard margins, in 12-point Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman font.
- Leave page headers completely blank/empty. Leave page footers blank except for page numbers.
- Don't use borders, backgrounds, or anything decorative (necessary figures or tables are fine).
- Insert a tab at the beginning of each new paragraph.
- Include in-text citations and a reference list at the end of drafts and final papers. Guidelines are on the [Citations](link) page.
- Follow American Psychological Association (APA) formatting rules for capitalization [(here)](https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.HTML) and italics [(here)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/italics-quotations/italics). Hint: you have to actually click those links and read those pages if you want correct formatting; don't rely on me to do it for you.
- Put a word count at the end of the paper, before the reference list.
- Give your papers an appropriate title. Center your title and use the same font as your body text, with no additional formatting. See more information on titles on "Writing topics" pages.
- Do not use a cover page. Instead, provide the following information at the top left-hand corner of the first page (not in the header):

```
 Your Name
 Prof. Frome - NTW2029
 Paper 1 Draft (after you revise it, "Paper 1 Final")
 Assignment due date
```

- Don't skip an extra line between paragraphs. The space between the last line of one paragraph and and the first line of the next should be the same as the space between lines within a paragraph. (Skipping lines between paragraphs can work well for online writing, but not academic essays).
  - To remove the extra spacing between paragraphs in Microsoft Word:
    - Go to the Home tab on the ribbon
    - Find the Paragraph section
    - Click the little "more" arrow in the lower right corner of the box
    - Check/fill the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" option
    - To make this option your default for new documents, click the box "Set as Default", choose "Set as default for all new documents...", and if you are prompted to save the Normal template, choose to do so
